# Itinerary Choice Examples

**Example Data**

The example itinerary choice bundled with Larch is based on data derived from a ticketing database
provided by the Airlines Reporting Corporation. The data represent ten origin destination
pairs for travel in U.S. continental markets in May of 2013.   Itinerary characteristics
have been masked, e.g., carriers are labeled generically as "carrier X" and departure times
have been aggregated into categories. A fare is provided but is not completely accurate (a
random error has been added to each fare). These modifications were made to satisfy
nondisclosure agreements, so that the data can be published freely for teaching and
demostration purposes.  It is generally representative of real itinerary choice data used
in practice, and the results obtained from this data are intuitive from a behavioral
perspective, but it is not quite accurate and should not be used for behavioral studies.
