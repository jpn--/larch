Here we provide some illustrative examples.
You can reproduce all of these examples in your own install of Larch,
as all of the example data is included with the standard distribution.
To work with any objects you find in the examples, a handy function
is provided to extract that object directly into your workspace:

.. autofunction:: larch.example
