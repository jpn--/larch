This documentation is for the Python interface for Larch. If this is your first go
with Larch, or the first go on a new computer, you might want to start with [installation](installation).

This project is very much under development.  There are plenty of undocumented functions
and features; use them at your own risk.  Undocumented features may be non-functional,
not rigorously tested, deprecated or removed without notice in a future version.  If a
function or method is documented here, it is intended to be stable in future updates.
