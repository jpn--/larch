300: Itinerary Choice Data
=====================================

.. testsetup:: *

   import larch
   import os


The example itinerary choice described here is based on data derived from a ticketing database
provided by the Airlines Reporting Corporation. The data represent ten origin destination
pairs for travel in U.S. continental markets in May of 2013.   Itinerary characteristics
have been masked, e.g., carriers are labeled generically as "carrier X" and departure times
have been aggregated into categories. A fare is provided but is not completely accurate (a
random error has been added to each fare). These modifications were made to satisfy
nondisclosure agreements, so that the data can be published freely for teaching and
demostration purposes.  It is generally representative of real itinerary choice data used
in practice, and the results obtained from this data are intuitive from a behavioral
perspective, but it is not quite accurate and should not be used for behavioral studies.


In this example we will import the air itinerary choice example dataset, starting from a csv
text file in |idca| format.  Suppose that data file is gzipped, named "arc.csv.gz" and
is located in the current directory (use :func:`os.getcwd` to see what is the
current directory).

.. tip::

	If you want to practice with this example, you can put this file into the
	current directory by using the command::

		larch.DB.Example().export_idca("arc.csv.gz", exclude={'caseid','altid'})


.. testcode::
	:hide:

	os.chdir(os.path.join(larch._directory_,"data_warehouse"))



We can take a peek at the contents of the file, examining the first 70 lines:

.. doctest::
	:options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

	>>> import gzip
	>>> with gzip.open("arc.csv.gz", 'rt') as previewfile:
	...     print(*(next(previewfile) for x in range(70)))

The first line of the file contains column headers. After that, each line represents
an alternative available to one or more decision makers. In our sample data, we see the first 67
lines of data share a ``id_case`` of 1, indicating that they are 67 different itineraries
available to the first decision maker type.  An identidier of the alternatives is given by the
number in the column ``id_alt``, although this number is simply a sequential counter within each case
in the raw data, and conveys no other information about the itinerary or its attributes.
The observed choices of the decision maker[s] are indicated in the column ``choice``.
That column counts the number of travelers who face this choice set and chose the itinerary
described by this row in the file.

We can import this data easily:


.. doctest::

	>>> d = larch.DB.CSV_idca("arc.csv.gz", caseid="id_case", altid="id_alt", choice="choice")

We can then look at some of the attibutes of the imported data:

.. doctest::
	:options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

	>>> d.variables_ca()
	('caseid', 'altid', 'id_case', 'id_alt', 'choice', 'nb_cnxs', 'elapsed_time', 'fare_hy', 'fare_ly', 'equipment', 'carrier', 'timeperiod')
	>>> d.variables_co()
	('caseid', 'id_case', 'traveler', 'origin', 'destination')
	>>> d.alternative_codes()
	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 125, 126, 127)

Larch automatically analyzed the data file to find variables that do not vary within
cases, and transformed those into |idco| format variables.  If you would prefer that
Larch not do this you can set the keyword argument tablename_co to ``None``.  This is particularly
important for larger datasets (the data sample included is only a tiny extract of the data
that might be available for this kind of model), as breaking the data into seperate |idca| and |idco| parts is
a relatively expensive operation, and it is not actually required for most model structures.:

.. doctest::
	:options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

	>>> d1 = larch.DB.CSV_idca("arc.csv.gz", tablename_co=None, caseid="id_case", altid="id_alt", choice="choice")
	>>> d1.variables_ca()
	('caseid', 'altid', 'id_case', 'id_alt', 'choice', 'traveler', 'origin', 'destination', 'nb_cnxs', 'elapsed_time', 'fare_hy', 'fare_ly', 'equipment', 'carrier', 'timeperiod')
	>>> d1.variables_co()
	('caseid',)
	>>> d.alternative_codes()
	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 125, 126, 127)

In this case the set of variables in the |idco| table isn't actually empty, because that
table is actually now expressed as a special view of the single |idca| table:

.. doctest::
	:options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

	>>> d1.queries.qry_idco()
	'SELECT DISTINCT caseid AS caseid FROM (SELECT id_case AS caseid, id_alt AS altid, * FROM data)'


In either case, the set of all possible alternatives is deduced automatically from all the values
in the ``altid`` column.  You will note that, while the sample case we have peeked at in the beginning
of the raw data file has 67 alternatives, there are other observations in the file with alternatives numbering
up to 127.
