**Example Data**

The MTC sample dataset is the same data used in the
`Self Instructing Manual <http://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/Bhat/COURSES/LM_Draft_060131Final-060630.pdf>`_
for discrete choice modeling: "The San Francisco Bay Area work mode choice data set comprises 5029 home-to-work commute trips in the
San Francisco Bay Area. The data is drawn from the San Francisco Bay Area Household Travel Survey
conducted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) in the spring and fall of 1990. This
survey included a one day travel diary for each household member older than five years and detailed
individual and household socio-demographic information."

You can use this data to reproduce the example models in that
document, and several examples are provided here to do so.
